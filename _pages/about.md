I also go by `Carl Zhang` (nickname: `LittleHealth`).

# About me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [School of Software Engineering](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Shaoxu Song](https://sxsong.github.io/). Prior to that, I completed my M.S. and B.S. in the School of Software Engineering at Tsinghua University.

My research focuses on: (1) time series database, (2) distributed storage/consensus, and (3) data science agents.

## Experience

<!-- + [Institute for Intelligent Computing, Alibaba Group](https://tongyi.aliyun.com/)** — Researcher Intern, Dec 2025 - Now
  + Advised by [Rong Zhu](https://redgitcard.github.io/redgitcard/); studied NL2SQL data analysis challenges in large-scale schemas, exploring efficient schema compression and semantic representation. -->

+ [Definite Capital Management](https://zding.fund/about), Researcher Intern, Feb 2022 - Jun 2022
  + Simplified high-frequency quantitative trading factor computation and refactored the streaming computation framework, improving long-term real-time performance in production.

+ [Huaxiaozhu Strategy Department, DiDi Global Inc.](https://www.didiglobal.com/), Algorithm Engineer Intern, Jun 2021 - Sep 2021 
  + Implemented a causal multi-treatment uplift random forest, achieving ~15% ROI improvement.

## Projects

+ [AgentScope: Data Profiling](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope-samples/pull/110) 
  + Designed an LLM-oriented data profiling framework that transforms heterogeneous data into agent-consumable schemas, improving real-world generalization.

+ [Apache IoTDB](https://github.com/apache/iotdb): MemTable and Consensus Optimization  
  + **MemTable:** Proposed *Backward-Sort* and *Deferred Flushing* to reduce write amplification from out-of-order writes.  
  + **Consensus:** Proposed *LSM-Raft*, a generalized Raft protocol for LSM-tree engines, minimizing redundant compaction and state transfer.

## Leadership

+ **Chair of Graduate Student Union, School of Software**, June 2022 - June 2023
  + Resolved long-standing issues (e.g., parking shed renovation in East Building).  
  + Led teams to awards including Outstanding Graduate Student Union and Five-Star Ph.D. Forum.
